# CRUD -> Create, Read, Update, Delete

In Roles CRUD, we have the name of employee, their role and the name of their administrator.
In Employees CRUD, we have the name of employees, their mobile and email.
In RoleRead, we can read the role of an employee from Roles CRUD using their id(which is unique).
